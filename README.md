# SYSTEM_DESIGN_BEST_NOTES

Software design or System design is one of the trickiest concepts to master. You can quickly learn a programming language like Java or Python but creating software using that programming language is a totally different thing. That's where software design and coding skills come to the rescue. It's actually an art to structure your program, design your modules, specify boundaries and interactions with other parts of the system so that they are easier to read, maintain, and flexible to change.

System design is less about coding and more about system analysis, architectural patterns, APIs, design patterns, and gluing it all together. Designing your system appropriately for the requirements of your application will minimize unnecessary costs and maintenance efforts, as well as provide a better experience for your end-users because your application will be able to handle the architectural load.

When it comes to tech interviews, it’s difficult to neglect system design! Almost every product-based company, whether it’s Facebook, Amazon, Google, or another, asks a series of questions based on System Design concepts such as scalability, load balancing, caching, and so on, during the interview.
